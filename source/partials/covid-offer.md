<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

Pantheon is extending our [COVID WebOps offer](http://pantheon.io/blog/supporting-orgs-on-covid-19-front-line?docs) to qualified government, medical, or educational institutions with a crisis communications website, and to non-profit organizations directly providing relief.

We launched this initiative at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to support organizations responding to the pandemic or delivering vital information to the public. It's since evolved to include a pre-built response site to allow organizations on the COVID-19 front lines to deploy rapidly and deliver emergency communications.
